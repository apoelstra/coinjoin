BUILDING
============

Install rustc and the openssl libs (no EC, Fedora is fine).
Then just type
  make


USAGE
===============

STEP ONE
========
All parties who want to coinjoin create a raw transaction using
createrawtransaction. They submit these to one individual, who enters
them into CoinJoiner by running

  ./coinjoin-merge-unsigned

Then just copy/paste the transactions in, one on each line, followed
by a blank line. The output will be an unsigned merged transaction. If
there were any signatures in the original transactions, these are
stripped since they would now be invalid.


STEP TWO
========
This merged transaction is distributed to the original parties, who
each sign it. Then they send these back to the individual running
CoinJoiner, who merges them by running

  ./coinjoin-merge-signed

Then just copy/paste the signed transactions in, one on each line,
followed by a blank line. The output will be a merged, signed
transaction that can be submitted to the bitcoin network. Further, the
order of the inputs and outputs in this transaction is randomized.
